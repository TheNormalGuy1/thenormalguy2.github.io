    <p>The Spread app is a personal information and calendar task manager that assists the user in keeping track of life scheduling and serves as a storage location for information the user needs. There is a large load of information people need to keep track of throughout life, and a lot of that is attached to a date, such as appointment details and warranties. There are plenty of ways to store such information, but it is hard to do it in one place while having it accessible regardless of location or device. There are many options for password managers as well as calendars, but not as many combine the need for storage and scheduling.</p>
    
    <p>Serving as something of a life manager, Spread takes in clues about things a user needs to store and remember, associating tasks and timeframes with each item as needed. There are many items that people need to be aware of on a repeating basis, including password resets, warranty expirations, subscriptions, OS security updates, and financial due dates. Alongside their everyday events, like classes or appointments, Spread fits these items into a user’s schedule and can bring them up at times when the user can effectively handle them.</p>
    
    <p>People often find themselves needing to receive passcodes, part numbers, registration IDs, financial information, and license details. Users can dump all this into Spread and allow it to organize the data, splitting it into tasks, appointments/due dates, or both. However, having to enter such information manually is regularly necessary but also tedious. Spread can automatically parse notifications from your email and messages to break them down, offering to add the details to the app. For example, if a user gets an email saying that they have a package ready for pickup, Spark could add the pickup location into a task and produce a calendar notification for an appropriate time.</p>

    <p>Spread is targeted at technologically acute adults ages 20 to 40 of all genders who strive to maintain an independent lifestyle. They could be in school and/or work, where they may struggle to keep track of an abundance of information from their personal as well as professional lives. While they are independent, they likely have several others who depend on them to get things done as well as people whom they receive ongoing support from. They enjoy but also require efficiency, being able to perform tasks in the least amount of steps possible. Given their environment, they may need to regularly share information quickly with others.</p>

    <p>For Spread to function, the system it is running on must have the ability to receive inputs from a mouse or touch screen and receive a good amount of text so people can enter in tasks and information. The app will function best with an Internet connection, most likely with WiFi on mobile devices, alongside cloud syncing abilities, allowing it to sync between devices whenever possible. The system should load pages in under 3 seconds and store them locally in case the cloud connection is lost. The system should be able to allow the app access to other pieces of information on the device, such as related emails and messages. The user should be able to disable things like cloud service and disk access without degradation in any other app functionality.</p>

    <p>Within the <strong>diffusion of innovation,</strong> many of the life tracking apps are in the early majority, involving plenty of connectivity and modern features. Most of them are web/internet based which allows people to sync their information and schedule to the cloud. In order to increase the spread across the line, it will need to focus on having features improving use longevity.</p>
