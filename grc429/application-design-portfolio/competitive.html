        <p>Below is a series of likely competitors to the Spread app. Each of them perform different combinations of to-do lists, calendar events, password management, time tracking, and organization. Most of these are either quite simple, such as simply containing a list of tasks, or more specialized.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Due is specifically designed for iPhones and iPads and allows you to jot down tasks and set reminders quickly.

The app also provides persistent reminders with auto snooze options. Until you mark the task as complete or reschedule the task, the auto snooze repeatedly notifies you of a task. Another excellent feature that sets it apart from other apps is the ability to send reminders to friends and colleagues.</p>

Team members can add comments, attachments, checklists, and custom labels to cards, keeping everyone on the same page.</p>

        <h2 id="technical-requirements">
        <a class="anchor" href="#technical-requirements"></a>Technical requirements
        </h2>
            <p>For Spread to function, the system it is running on must have the ability to receive inputs from a mouse or touch screen and receive a good amount of text so people can enter in tasks and information. The app will function best with an Internet connection, most likely with WiFi on mobile devices, alongside cloud syncing abilities, allowing it to sync between devices whenever possible. The system should load pages in under 3 seconds and store them locally in case the cloud connection is lost. The system should be able to allow the app access to other pieces of information on the device, such as related emails and messages. The user should be able to disable things like cloud service and disk access without degradation in any other app functionality.</p>
