        <p>The Spread app is a personal information and calendar task manager that assists the user in keeping track of life scheduling and serves as a storage location for information the user needs. There is a large load of information people need to keep track of throughout life, and a lot of that is attached to a date, such as appointment details and warranties. There are plenty of ways to store such information, but it is hard to do it in one place while having it accessible regardless of location or device. There are many options for password managers as well as calendars, but not as many combine the need for storage and scheduling.</p>
        
        <p>Serving as something of a life manager, Spread takes in clues about things a user needs to store and remember, associating tasks and timeframes with each item as needed. There are many items that people need to be aware of on a repeating basis, including password resets, warranty expirations, subscriptions, OS security updates, and financial due dates. Alongside their everyday events, like classes or appointments, Spread fits these items into a userâ€™s schedule and can bring them up at times when the user can effectively handle them.</p>
        
        <p>People often find themselves needing to receive passcodes, part numbers, registration IDs, financial information, and license details. Users can dump all this into Spread and allow it to organize the data, splitting it into tasks, appointments/due dates, or both. However, having to enter such information manually is regularly necessary but also tedious. Spread can automatically parse notifications from your email and messages to break them down, offering to add the details to the app. For example, if a user gets an email saying that they have a package ready for pickup, Spread could add the pickup location into a task and produce a calendar notification for an appropriate time.</p>
