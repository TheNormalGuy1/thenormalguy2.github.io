        <p>Spread is targeted at technologically acute adults ages 20 to 40 of all genders who strive to maintain an independent lifestyle. They could be in school and/or work, where they may struggle to keep track of an abundance of information from their personal as well as professional lives. While they are independent, they likely have several others who depend on them to get things done as well as people whom they receive ongoing support from. They enjoy but also require efficiency, being able to perform tasks in the least amount of steps possible. Given their environment, they may need to regularly share information quickly with others.</p>
