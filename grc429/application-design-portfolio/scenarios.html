            <h2 id="scenarios"><a class="anchor" href="#scenarios"></a>Scenarios</h2>
            
            <h4>Scenario 1</h4>
            <p>Martha is a student and learns that she has homework due before her class on Thursday. Before she forgets, she opens the Spread app on her phone or laptop and enters in the assignment name under her self-made “School” tasks. By typing a quick tag, she can set a reminder for Wednesday evening that will be automatically added to her calendar and will send her a notification when the time comes. She can also add any notes, links, or other information to follow with the entry. She completes the assignment the next day, checks it off on her task list, and satisfyingly watches it go into her done folder while checking off on her calendar.</p>

            <h4>Scenario 2</h4>
            <p>James is at an auto shop and has been told that he needs to make another appointment for getting new tires installed alongside getting a new recall taken care of. The mechanic asks him if he wants to make another appointment then. James takes out his phone and opens Spread, finds that he is free on Friday, and asks to schedule the appointment then. He then adds a new calendar appointment to his Spread Calendar and also inputs a reminder, information on the tires he needs to choose, and the recall number. The appointment and notifications then automatically sync between his devices and creates a reminder on his task list to prepare for the appointment. </p>
            
            <h4>Scenario 3</h4>
            <p>Sid has just been employed at a new company where they have received an email saying they need to complete quarterly training to stay current. The Spread app comes up with a suggestion to add these trainings as tasks. They need to complete them now, but they are also reoccurring. Sid opens the app and adds tags to the reminders which will make them repeat once per quarter, adding calendar events, notifications, and new tasks each time they need to be done. Sid also adds links and usernames for the trainings so it is easier to find them later. Now, every time Sid needs to renew their certifications, Spread will remind them and have each one on their calendar and task list. </p>
